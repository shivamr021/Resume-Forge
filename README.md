## üìà Project Evolution & Learnings

This project was a journey of continuous improvement, evolving from a simple, rule-based script into a sophisticated hybrid AI application. Key milestones included:

* **Upgrading PDF Generation**: Migrated from `fpdf` to `fpdf2` to solve Unicode and font-embedding issues, enabling a more robust and visually appealing resume design.
* **Securing Credentials**: Implemented secure API key management using Streamlit's `secrets.toml` and a comprehensive `.gitignore` to prevent credential leaks.
* **Implementing a Hybrid AI Model**: Transitioned from a costly, API-only approach to a more efficient hybrid model:

  * Local KeyBERT for high-frequency quantitative ATS scoring.
  * Google Gemini for low-frequency, high-value qualitative feedback.

This balance created a scalable and cost-effective solution.
